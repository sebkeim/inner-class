Python does have built-in support for nested or inner classes. Theses classes can be used
when you do not want to expose the class, and it is closely related to another class.

Unfortunately this support is rather minimalistic and lack some useful features :


```python
 class MyOuter:
    @inner
    class MyInner:
       def hello(self):
           print('Hello')
```

### outer attribute

The inner class gain an 'outer' attribute that reference its outer class.

```python
  >>> MyOuter.MyInner.outer 
  <class '__main__.MyOuter'>
```


### inner derivation
 
When the outer class is derived, the inner class is also derived in order
to point at the derived outer class.

```python
 class MyChildOuter(MyOuter):
    pass

 >>> MyChildOuter.MyInner.outer
 <class '__main__.MyChildOuter'>
```

### carried inheritance

When the inner class is redefined in an outer subclass, it will automatically
derivate from the inner class of the outer superclass.


```python
  class MyChildOuter(MyOuter):
     class MyInner:
       pass

  >>> MyChildOuter.MyInner().hello()
  Hello
```

###  inner instantiation
 
the outer attribute of an inner instance store it's outer instance

```python
  outer = MyOuter()
  
  >>> outer
  <__main__.MyOuter object at 0x03BAA990>
  >>> outer.MyInner().outer
  <__main__.MyOuter object at 0x03BAA990>
```
